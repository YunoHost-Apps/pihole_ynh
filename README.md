No demo available.

## Configuration

Use the admin panel of your Pi-hole to configure this app. You may also need to follow the [post-install guide](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/post-install/) to setup Pi-hole either as a *DNS server* or a *DHCP server*.

## Documentation

* Official documentation: https://docs.pi-hole.net/
* Pi-hole as a DHCP server: [dhcp.md](./dhcp.md)
* YunoHost documentation: There is no other documentation. Feel free to contribute!

## YunoHost specific features

* Private access to the admin panel.

#### Multi-users support

#### Supported architectures

* x86-64b - [![](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/logs/pihole.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/apps/pihole/)
* ARMv8-A - [![](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/logs/pihole.svg)](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/apps/pihole/)

## Limitations

* Activate DHCP with Pi-hole needs manual configuration of your router.
* Pi-Hole can't be updated beyond version 3.3.1, because higher versions use an integrated version of dnsmasq. This would require disabling the version of dnsmasq used by YunoHost.
